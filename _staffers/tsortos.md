I am a rising senior from the bay, studying Chemical Engineering and Data Science. I currently research the intersection of ChemE and Data Sci in the Mesbah group (linked above if your curious). Iâ€™m also passionate about old music, nature, and bay area sports.  I'm always down to meet new people, talk about life, and work on some data science so don't hesitate to stop by my OH :)
