I am a senior from the UK majoring in applied math and cs, and I love teaching! When I’m not doing schoolwork or course staff related work, I play soccer for the Cal Men’s Club Soccer team and play funk music with my roommates (my favorite band right now is Vulfpeck). Other than that I like hiking the fire trails and occasionally at Mount Tamalpais.
