Hey there! I’m Rami and I’m a senior from Sacramento studying EECS. I love going out on photo shoots and I absolutely love anything related to dogs! DS 100 has been one of my favorite courses, and I’m very excited to get to teach it once again! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or any cute dog pics!
