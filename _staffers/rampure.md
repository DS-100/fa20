Hey! I'm a 5th year Master's student in the EECS department advised by Josh Hug. This is my sixth semester helping teach this class, and over the years I've become very particular about calling it "Data 100" and not "DS 100" 🤷🏽‍♂️. I'm originally from 🇨🇦, which is where I'll be this semester. Don't hesitate to reach out about literally anything!
