Hey everyone, Iâ€™m a rising Senior from Mumbai majoring in statistics and data science. This is my first semester as Head TA and fourth semester as TA for Data 100. My interests include food, hiking, and comedy, so feel free to hit me up with your recommendations for restaurants, hiking trails, and standup specials. 

You can ask me about the class too (I guess)
