## About Data 100


Combining data, computation, and inferential thinking, data science is redefining how people and organizations solve challenging problems and understand their world. This intermediate level class bridges between [Data8](http://data8.org) and upper division computer science and statistics courses as well as methods courses in other fields. In this class, we explore key areas of data science including question formulation, data collection and cleaning, visualization, statistical inference, predictive modeling, and decision making.​ Through a strong emphasis on data centric computing, quantitative critical thinking, and exploratory data analysis, this class covers key principles and techniques of data science. These include languages for transforming, querying and analyzing data; algorithms for machine learning methods including regression, classification and clustering; principles behind creating informative data visualizations; statistical concepts of measurement error and prediction; and techniques for scalable data processing.

### Goals

- Prepare students for advanced Berkeley courses in data-management, machine learning, and statistics, by providing the necessary foundation and context
- Enable students to start careers as data scientists by providing experience working with real-world data, tools, and techniques
- Empower students to apply computational and inferential thinking to address real-world problems

### Prerequisites

While we are working to make this class widely accessible, we currently require the following (or equivalent) prerequisites. **We are not enforcing prerequisites during enrollment. However, all of the prerequisties will be used starting very early on in the class. It is your responsibility to know the material in the prerequisites.**:

- **Foundations of Data Science**: [Data8](http://data8.org) covers much of the material in Data 100 but at an introductory level. Data8 provides basic exposure to python programming and working with tabular data as well as visualization, statistics, and machine learning.
- **Computing**: _The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_ ([CS 61A](http://cs61a.org)) or _Computational Structures in Data Science_ ([CS 88](https://cs88-website.github.io)). These courses provide additional background in python programming (e.g., for loops, lambdas, debugging, and complexity) that will enable Data 100 to focus more on the concepts in Data Science and less on the details of programming in python.
- **Math**: _Linear Algebra_ (Math 54, [EE 16a](http://ee16a.org), or Stat89a): We will need some basic concepts like linear operators, eigenvectors, derivatives, and integrals to enable statistical inference and derive new prediction algorithms. This may be satisfied concurrently to Data 100.

## Online Format

This fall, Data 100 will be run entirely online. This section details exactly how each component of the course will operate.

- To see when any live events are scheduled, check the [Calendar](../calendar).
- To see when lectures, discussions, and assignments are released (and due), check the [Home Page](../).

### Lecture

- There are 2 lectures per week.
- **Lectures will be entirely pre-recorded**, in a format that is optimized for online learning (short 5-10 minute videos with conceptual problems in between). Lecture videos will be released on the mornings of Tuesday and Thursday.
  - Some of these will be from previous semesters, and some will be recorded this fall by the instructors.
  - Lecture videos will be posted on YouTube. Each “lecture” will be an html page linked on the course website, containing videos and links to slides and code.
  - There are "Quick Check" conceptual questions in between each lecture video, linked on the lecture webpage. These are meant for you to check your understanding of the concepts that were just introduced. **These are graded on completion.** For each lecture, you will be required to submit a code to Gradescope that you will receive after completing one of the Quick Checks for that lecture.
  - Each lecture will also have a Piazza thread for students to ask questions.

Note: Alongside each lecture are textbook readings. Textbook readings are purely supplementary, and may contain material that is not in scope (and may also not be comprehensive).

<br>

### Homeworks and Projects

Homeworks are week-long assignments that are designed to help students develop an in-depth understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of ideas presented in lecture. Projects are two-week-long assignments that integrate these ideas with real-world datasets.

- In a typical week, homework is released on Friday and is due the following Thursday at 11:59PM.
- Near the midterm, or during weeks in which a project is assigned, you will have more than one week to work on the current assignment.
- One or two homeworks will be on-paper written assignments; the rest will be Jupyter notebooks.
- The primary form of support students will have for homeworks and projects are the **office hours** we’ll host, and **Piazza**.

<br>

### Labs

Labs are shorter programming assignments designed to give students familiarity with new ideas.
- In a typical week, lab is released on Friday and is due the following Tuesday.
- To help with lab, we will host **live lab sections** on Monday at various times, in which GSIs will walk through the assignment via Zoom. See the [Calendar](../calendar) for when these are scheduled.
- Students can also get help with labs at **office hours** and on **Piazza**.

<br>

### Discussions

Discussion sections are meant to allow students a chance to discuss conceptual ideas and solve problems with other students, with the help of a GSI (this becomes slightly harder given the fact that this course is being offered completely remotely). Each discussion consists of a worksheet.

- In a typical week, we will release the discussion worksheet on Wednesday morning.
- There are two “pathways” we envision students taking when it comes to consuming discussion content.
  1. Watching a pre-recorded discussion video.
  - Each discussion worksheet will be accompanied with a GSI-created video walkthrough, released at the same time. Students should watch this video soon after it is released.
  - With any lingering questions, students should come to office hours.
  2. Coming to a live Zoom discussion section.
  - We will be holding live discussion sections at several times on Wednesdays. In the first few weeks, students will be able to attend whichever section they desire, but we will eventually require you to sign up for a particular section if you want to keep attending (this is to keep sections small and personal).

<br>

### Office Hours
- We plan on hosting roughly 10 hours of office hours each weekday. These hours are listed on the [Calendar](../calendar).
- OH will serve as a one-stop shop for students to get help with assignments.
- Office Hours can be accessed via [oh.ds100.org](oh.ds100.org), where students add themselves to the "queue" and specify the assignment they need help on. Once it's their turn, they will be provided with a Zoom link to join, in order to get help from staff.
- The instructors will also be hosting conceptual office hours. These will be reflected on the [Calendar](../calendar).

<br>

### Exams

There will be one midterm exam (tentatively scheduled for October 15th) and a final exam (scheduled by campus for December 15th, 3-6PM). Details about dates can be found in the policies section below.

### Collaboration Policy and Academic Dishonesty

#### Assignments
Data science is a collaborative activity. While you may talk with others about the homework, we ask that you write your solutions individually in your own words. If you do discuss the assignments with others please include their names at the top of your notebook. Keep in mind that content from assignments will likely be covered on both the midterm and final.

If we suspect that you have submitted plagiarized work, we will call you in for a meeting. If we then determine that plagiarism has occurred, we reserve the right to give you a negative full score (-100%) or lower on the assignments in question, along with reporting your offense to the Center of Student Conduct.

Rather than copying someone else's work, ask for help. You are not alone in this course! The entire staff is here to help you succeed. If you invest the time to learn the material and complete the assignments, you won't need to copy any answers. (taken from [61A](https://cs61a.org/articles/about.html#academic-honesty))


#### Exams

Cheating on exams is a serious offense. We have methods of detecting cheating on exams – so don't do it! Students caught cheating on any exam will fail this course.  We will be following the [EECS departmental policy on Academic Honesty](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/students/academic-dishonesty), so be sure you are familiar with it.
