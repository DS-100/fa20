## Office Hours Calendar

GSI and tutor office hours are in <span style="color:Gray">**grey**</span>. Click on each event to see which GSI or tutor is running each office hour time. You should come to these with questions about anything – labs, homeworks, projects, discussions, concepts, etc. To access GSI and tutor office hours, go to our [Office Hours Queue](http://oh.ds100.org). When it’s your turn, you will be given the Zoom link to join.

Prof. Joseph and Prof. Perez' office hours are in <span style="color:#b2505b">**dark pink**</span>. You should come to these with questions about concepts. To access instructor office hours, use the Zoom links posted on Piazza.

Lost office hours are also in <span style="color:#b2505b">**dark pink**</span>. You should come to these if you feel behind in the course and would like help with the material (but not with assignments).
